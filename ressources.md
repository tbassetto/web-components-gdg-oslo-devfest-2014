Web Components is 4 specs
Primitives to give developers more power
- template
- shadow dom
- import HTML
- custome element

We can reimplement current UI / non-UI HTML5 elements with Web Components.

Current browser support?

Polyfill or sugar coating? Yes. Polymet is best.

Polymer is an opinionated sugar on top of Web Components
Polyfill
Core elements <core-ajax> trololo
Paper elements
Material

Polymer is not the polyfill. Polyfills are used by others like Brick
Polymer is not Material Design

You can use them fore more than just drop-in element. FUll framework.

How about performance? Inconsistent.

How does it play AngularJS? EmberJS? ReactJS?

Example apps? GitHub and Khan Academy use sparsely. PolyMail or Topeka for real app. Blah.
The mobile SDK of Salesforce. One of their reference app.
NewsCorp experiments a lot.
YouTube, video list for some users.
QuickOffice have a rewrite arriving soon.
Google Translate new upcoming interface.
Santa Tracker!!!

<template> is DOM, not string, content is inert (no script execution, no image download)

Prefect for adding elements to your API
Add a Google Map marker #trololo
